## YYY

### What

Another web client of [Japanese Yahoo! Auction service](https://auctions.yahoo.co.jp/)

### Why

It's hard to list **only newly posted articles** in Yahoo! Auction. It provides a notification system on specific keywords, but some articles need to be checked up every time, in such as apparel category.

### How

Twitter login + Redis storage. You can list articles in YYY and **archive** them to not be listed anymore, so that you can always list new products.

#### Technology Stack

	* Server-side Rendering
	* GraphQL
	* Apollo Client
		* Optimistic response
		* Skelton screen

	* React
	* JSDom for scraping, since Yahoo! Auction stopped to provide API in early 2018 :(

* Redis
* Twitter API
